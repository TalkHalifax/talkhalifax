# TalkHalifax: the platform as it is

_A record of everything running on November 8, 2026 (Phase 6 under way). Update it when something changes._

Live at https://talkhalifax.ca (`talkhalifax.com` and `.org` redirect there). The old
`talkhalifax.alexwmmolloy.workers.dev` address redirects browsers and still serves the agents, Telegram and the Events job. Repo: github.com/TalkHalifax/talkhalifax (moved from a personal account to the TalkHalifax organization on Nov. 7, 2026).

```

| Part | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Worker | `src/index.ts` | Routing (`/api/*`, `/auth/*`, chat rooms, the newsroom and Telegram), security headers, the 30-minute cron (current weather, weather warnings, a check on the Transit schedule's end date, a check that library events are arriving, story stages, clean-up) |
| API routes | `src/routes/` | The site's own `/api/*` handlers, one module per area: `me` (your account, your messages, deleting it), `stories`, `users` (public profiles), `reports`, `mod-tools` (bans, reset links), `comments`, `review` (held drafts, moving stories between stages), `page-stats`. `story-rows.ts` holds the shared story query. `src/index.ts` tries them in order, with the hand-offs to weather, alerts, Transit, events, push and the newsroom between `page-stats` and `comments` |
| Auth | `src/auth.ts` | Password and Google sign-in, sessions (HttpOnly cookie), Turnstile, reset links, rate limits |
| Halifax Water | `src/halifax-water.ts` | Reads its listing pages (it has no feed), sets how soon each is worked (on the site, only a boil-water advisory pins to Home), and strips the site-wide banner from its pages |
| Stories | `src/stories.ts` | Saving stories and versions, Developing → Articles, comments, approvals |
| Chat rooms | `src/room.ts` | One Durable Object per story: history, presence, typing, screening, bans, removals |
| Screening | `src/screen.ts` | Rules (slurs, phone numbers, emails, new-account links), then Llama Guard with a 3 s limit |
| Moderation | `src/moderation.ts` | Reports, bans, purges, account deletion |
| Newsroom MCP | `src/mcp.ts` | The tools agents use (below) |
| Telegram | `src/telegram.ts` | Drafts and held updates to the editor with buttons; plain notes |
| Weather | `src/weather.ts` | Environment Canada's current conditions for the small line in the header and phone menu. Wind chill and humidex are used only when they apply at that temperature, because the feed can carry stale values |
| Weather warnings | `src/alerts.ts` | Environment Canada warnings, watches and statements for the banners, Notices and `conditions` |
| Site | `public/index.html`, `public/styles.css`, `public/app.js`, `public/api.js`, `public/chat.js`, `public/views/` | The page and the CSS design system (`styles.css`, see [DESIGN-SYSTEM.md](DESIGN-SYSTEM.md)). `app.js` is an ES module with the shared helpers, state and routing; `api.js` fetches from `/api`, `chat.js` runs the live chat, and `views/` has one module per view (`home`, `articles`, `notices`, `article`, `moderation`, `user`, `reset`, `profile`). No bundler. The service worker caches every one of these files for offline use: add a new module to `SHELL_FILES` in `sw.js` and bump `VERSION` |
| Transit map | `src/transit.ts`, `public/transit.js`, `scripts/build-transit.mjs` | Live buses and ferries and service alerts from Halifax Transit's GTFS-realtime feeds; route lines and names from its GTFS schedule |
| Events | `src/events.ts`, `public/events.js` | The Events tab: Halifax Public Libraries' events for the next two weeks, stored in `feeds` ('events') and shown as the library lists them. The feed refuses Cloudflare, so a GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/events.yml`, started every 6 hours by the Worker's cron, `src/github-jobs.ts`) runs `scripts/fetch-events.mjs`, which posts the raw RSS pages to `POST /api/events/ingest` (Bearer `EVENTS_TOKEN`); the Worker parses and stores them |
| Push alerts | `src/push.ts`, `public/alerts.js` | Readers opt in from the Alerts section of their profile, no account needed (kinds, quiet hours; `/#alerts` links land there). A new live notice offers the editor "Send alert" on Telegram; only that tap sends. Web Push with VAPID and aes128gcm, done with WebCrypto |
| App shell | `public/sw.js`, `public/manifest.webmanifest`, `public/icons/` | Installable app; the service worker keeps the shell, stories you've read and the events list for offline reading, and shows push alerts |
| Anonymous counts | `src/stats.ts`, `public/stats.js` | Open pages report to one `StatsHub` Durable Object about every 2 minutes (`POST /api/stats`, capped per IP address by the `STATS_LIMIT` rate limiter; reports over the cap are dropped). It writes totals to D1: each story's impressions and clicks per hour, every 10 minutes, and how many pages are open every 5 minutes. A page's random id stays in the hub's memory for at most about 6 minutes and never reaches D1 |
| Admin site | `admin/` | A separate Worker at `admin.talkhalifax.ca` on the same D1 database, read-only for now: Home (what needs the editor, four charts over time), Users, Content (every screen, plus sources) and Administration (job health). Behind the editor's username and password (a signed 12-hour cookie; 5 tries a minute per IP address), or Cloudflare Access if its settings are present, in which case it checks Access's signed token itself. It refuses everything until one of them is set up. It has no `workers.dev` address and never returns email addresses, password hashes, personas or Google ids |
| Guidelines | `newsroom/guidelines.md` | How stories are written; bundled into the Worker and served by `get_guidelines` |
| Schema | `migrations/0001`–`0013` | D1 tables (below) |
| Tests | `test/unit/`, `test/e2e/routes.mjs`, `test/hooks/` | `npm test`: the rules on the Workers runtime (screening, timing, approvals, bans, rate limits, events). `npm run test:e2e`: every page and story kind in a browser, with throwaway data. `npm run test:hooks`: the agent guard against sample policies in `test/hooks/fixtures/` |
| Agent guard | `.claude/hooks/agent-guard.mjs`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/agents/policy/` | Holds each agent that has a policy file to that policy (below) |
| Deploy | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | Every push to `main` (which now arrives only by a merged pull request): type check, unit tests, agent guard tests and a browser check (any failure stops the deploy; pull requests run these as the `check` job), D1 migrations, `wrangler deploy`, a smoke test, and a rollback if it fails. Then the admin Worker, and a check that it refuses anyone who hasn't signed in |

## Content model

A **story** has a `kind`:
- `article`: a civic story people can act on or discuss. "What to do" (`actions`, when there is something), body with optional subheadings, key details, live chat, then comments. Older articles keep their `means` points at the bottom.
- `notice`: urgent or safety facts only, no interpretation, no comments. Can be `supersededBy` a newer notice.
- `skip`: a release we decided not to cover (with a reason), so it isn't picked up again.

And a **stage**:
- `draft`: waiting for the editor (every new article when Telegram is on, and anything sent with `review: true`).
- `developing`: on Home with a live chat. Articles move to Articles once quiet: no newsroom update for 12 hours and
  no chat for 3 hours, or after a week.
- `archived`: under Articles, chat closed, comments open. A significant follow-up can reopen it.

Every change is a new row in `story_versions`. Changes to published stories wait in `pending_updates` (ids like `u12`)
until the editor approves.

**Leads** are the queue of possible stories: `open` → `claimed` (2-hour claim) → `done` or `dropped`. Each has a
category that sets priority: P0 `right-now`, P1 `talk-of-the-town` (200+ searches), P2 `money-and-homes`,
P3 `decisions`, P4 `community`.

## Sources

| Source | Used for | How |
|---|---|---|
| halifax.ca news releases | Articles and notices | `scan_sources`, `read_release` |
| halifaxwater.ca notices, alerts and news | Water notices (boil-water advisories, shut-offs, main repairs, traffic advisories) | same; `scan_sources` lists it under `unavailable` if the site can't be read, and marks `sourceChanged` on a page edited since we last handled it. Urgent notices get hourly check-ins |
| news.novascotia.ca | Provincial stories that touch Halifax | same |
| rcmp.ca (Halifax-area detachments) | Police notices, always reviewed | same |
| Environment Canada | Weather warnings (notices and banners), current conditions (header and menu) | `conditions`, cron |
| Nova Scotia Power outage map | Outage notices (2,000+ customers) | `conditions` |
| Halifax Transit GTFS-realtime (gtfs.halifax.ca) | Transit map: vehicle positions and service alerts | `/api/transit/*`, fetched at most every 12 s (alerts 2 min) per Worker isolate |
| Halifax Transit GTFS schedule | Transit map: routes, lines, headsigns, stop names | `.github/workflows/transit.yml`, started weekly by the Worker's cron, rebuilds with `scripts/build-transit.mjs` once a new schedule has started, and deploys; the cron warns the editor in the schedule's last week |
| Halifax Public Libraries events (BiblioCommons RSS) | Events tab, listed as posted | Fetched by the Events GitHub Action every 6 hours (about 16 requests) and posted to the Worker; the cron warns the editor when it's over 26 hours old |
| Google Trends (Nova Scotia) | Signal: raises lead priority | `trending` |
| r/halifax | Signal: something may be happening | `trending` |

## Newsroom tools (MCP at `/mcp`)

`get_guidelines`, `my_profile`, `set_profile`, `scan_sources`, `trending`, `conditions`, `read_release`,
`list_stories`, `get_story`, `publish_story`, `update_story`, `list_leads`, `file_lead`, `prioritize_lead`,
`claim_lead`, `complete_lead`, `room_activity`, `checkin_queue`, `record_checkin`, `await_review`,
`desk_status` (the newsroom at a glance), `notify_editor` (a plain note to the editor on Telegram, 24 a day).

From a terminal or a cloud routine: `node scripts/newsroom.mjs tool <name> [json | @file.json]`.

## Site features

- **Weather**: icon and "Feels like" in the header on desktop (the temperature alone on narrow screens) and at the bottom of the phone menu, linking to Environment Canada. Hidden if the reading is over 3 hours old.
- **Home**: developing stories as cards, latest first, with live people counts; urgent notices and weather warnings
  in banners under the header.
- **Transit** (`#transit`, or `#transit-<route>`): a live map of every bus and ferry (MapLibre, OpenFreeMap tiles),
  updated every 15 seconds. Pick a route to see only it and its line; tap a vehicle for its headsign, next stop, speed,
  seats and the route's service alerts.
- **Articles** and **Notices**: archived articles and current notices.
- **Events** (`#events`): what's on at the libraries over the next two weeks, filtered by when, who it's for and area,
  with Highlights from the library's featured events, special events and performances.
- **Alerts**, a section of the profile (old `#alerts` links scroll to it; no account needed): turn push alerts on for urgent notices, pick kinds (weather, outages, roads and transit,
  police and emergencies, other) and quiet hours. Offered under a notice, never on a first visit.
- **Installable and offline**: Add to Home Screen on phones, install on desktop. The footer's Install the app opens the
  browser's own prompt, or on iPhone and Android a card with the steps. Without a connection the app opens,
  shows an offline bar, and stories you've opened and the events list stay readable; chat waits for the connection.
- **Story**: the article or notice, its facts, version notes, the docked live chat (or comments once archived).
- **Chat**: live messages, typing, presence, report (⚑), screening with the text handed back if turned away.
- **Profiles**: your own (messages, password change, delete account, moderator reports) and public ones (the journalist's
  byline links to hers).
- **Moderators**: approve drafts in the browser or on Telegram, remove reported items, ban or ban-and-purge, make reset
  links. Moderators are listed in `ADMIN_USERNAMES` in `wrangler.jsonc`, and for Google sign-in in the `ADMIN_EMAILS` secret.
- **Privacy** page at `/#privacy`, linked from the footer, menu and sign-up.

## Data (D1 tables)

`users`, `sessions`, `auth_throttle` (rate limits, cleared after a day), `stories`, `story_versions`, `room_stats`,
`message_index` (a copy of every chat message), `comments`, `feeds` (cached weather, weather warnings and library events, plus the cron's failure counts), `leads`,
`pending_updates`, `reports`, `password_resets`, `push_subs` (one row per browser with alerts on: its push address,
keys, kinds and quiet hours; not tied to an account), `story_traffic` (each story's impressions and clicks per hour, kept 400 days), `online_samples` (pages open, every 5 minutes, kept 90 days). `stories.push_sent_at` and `push_count` record a sent alert. Live chat history itself lives in each room's Durable Object storage.

## Secrets and settings

On the Worker (`npx wrangler secret put <NAME>`): `NEWSROOM_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`,
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` and `ADMIN_EMAILS` (optional, for Google sign-in, none set), `TURNSTILE_SECRET` (set Nov. 6),
`VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` (push alerts; `node scripts/vapid-keys.mjs`, set Nov. 5), `EVENTS_TOKEN` (library events from GitHub; `node scripts/events-token.mjs` sets it here and on GitHub), `GITHUB_ACTIONS_TOKEN` (fine-grained GitHub token for this repo with Actions read and write, so the cron can start the Events and Transit jobs; a refusal reaches the editor on Telegram).
In `wrangler.jsonc` vars: `ADMIN_USERNAMES`, and `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` (public).
On the admin Worker (`--config admin/wrangler.jsonc`): `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (16 characters or more), or later `ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` and `ACCESS_AUD` for Cloudflare Access, which then replaces the password. It refuses everything until one pair is set.
GitHub repository secrets: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Workers Scripts Edit, D1 Edit; it also covers the Workers AI binding) and `EVENTS_TOKEN` (the Events workflow).
Cloud routines: environment variable `TALKHALIFAX_TOKEN` (the newsroom token) and network access to the site.

## The repo, `main` and the agent guard

**`main` is protected** by a GitHub ruleset (set Nov. 7, 2026, in the repo's settings rather than in files): every change needs a pull request, the `check` job must pass, nobody can bypass it, and force pushes and deleting `main` are refused. The Transit job's direct push to `main` is refused too until it changes (TECH-DEBT **D8**).

**`.github/CODEOWNERS`** names the editor as owner of every file. The ruleset doesn't require code-owner review yet, because agents act under the editor's GitHub account (TECH-DEBT **C11**).

**The agent guard** (`.claude/hooks/agent-guard.mjs`) is a `PreToolUse` hook, registered in `.claude/settings.json`, that runs before every tool call in Claude Code. It runs outside the model, so an agent can't talk past it. It only acts on a subagent with a policy file, `.claude/agents/policy/<name>.json`; the editor's own session and the build agents (no policy file) are unaffected. Policies are always read from the main checkout (`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`). Paths are judged against the session's linked worktree when it runs in one at `.claude/worktrees/<name>/` (as Claude Code desktop does), so the main checkout and other worktrees count as outside the repo. For an agent that has a policy, it checks:

- the tool is in the policy's list (PowerShell is always refused);
- edits stay inside the policy's allowed paths, and reads stay inside the repo;
- each Bash command is one plain command that matches an allowed pattern, token for token;
- WebFetch goes over https to an allowed domain;
- `Task`/`Agent` start only agents the policy names that have a policy of their own.

Whatever a policy says, it refuses:
- edits to anything under `.claude/`, `.github/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `migrations/`, `package.json`, `scripts/`, the test and build config, and the code that allowed commands run in plain Node;
- reading secret files (`.dev.vars`, `.env`, `.newsroom-token`, `.wrangler/` and similar);
- git subcommands outside a short allowlist (status, diff, log, show, add, commit, branch, push and a few more);
- pushes to `main`, force pushes and deletes, and merging pull requests;
- wrangler beyond `dev` (with a short list of flags), `types` and local `d1`, so no deploys, secrets or live database.

**Agents are changed through drafts.** Agent Operations drafts definitions and policies in `agent-drafts/`, which nothing loads. The reviewer commits them and opens a pull request. The editor reviews it, runs `npm run agents:promote` on the branch, then pushes and merges.

The promote script (`scripts/promote-agent-drafts.mjs`) needs a clean working tree and moves nothing unless every draft passes. It checks:
- every policy, with the guard's own validator;
- that each definition has a matching policy;
- each definition's front matter: only `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`, `color`, `effort` and `maxTurns`, with one `name:` equal to the file name, a `tools:` line, no duplicate keys, and no nested lines beyond a list of tools. `hooks`, `mcpServers`, `permissionMode`, `skills` and every other key are refused;
- that every tool the definition lists is in its policy's `tools`.

It then moves the drafts into `.claude/agents/` with `git mv`. No policy agent can run the promote script, or draft its own files, the orchestrator's or Agent Operations' (`agent-ops-*`). A policy file that is broken or has an unknown key refuses every tool. The policy format and the full list are in [`.claude/agents/policy/README.md`](../.claude/agents/policy/README.md). Tests: `npm run test:hooks`, run by CI in the `check` job.

## Web security settings

**Set on the three Cloudflare zones** (`talkhalifax.ca`, `.com`, `.org`), in the dashboard rather than this repo: Always Use HTTPS, minimum TLS 1.2, HSTS (6 months, no subdomains, no preload), DMARC `p=reject` on all three, SPF `-all` on `.com` and `.org`, and DNSSEC turned on. Bot Fight Mode is deliberately off.

**Set by the Worker** on every response except a chat's WebSocket upgrade (`secured()` in `src/index.ts`): `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` and `Permissions-Policy` (geolocation for the site itself, for the Transit map's locate button; no camera or microphone). HSTS isn't set here because the zone sends it.

The Content Security Policy is **report-only for now**: it blocks nothing, and browsers only note what it would have blocked. Turn it on as a separate change once the editor has seen a few days with no real violations. It allows unpkg (MapLibre), OpenFreeMap (map styles and tiles), Turnstile, Google Fonts, Google profile photos and library event photos. Inline `style=` attributes are allowed because `public/app.js` uses many.

**Request logs:** Workers Logs (`observability` in `wrangler.jsonc`) records each request's URL, IP address, browser details and approximate location, and for a signed-in reader joining a chat, their account ID (**D6**). The privacy notice describes this, so change it if the logging changes.

## Known issues and gaps

- **r/halifax returns HTTP 429** to the Worker (Reddit rate-limits Cloudflare's addresses), so the Reddit signal is
  usually missing. The journalist reports it and carries on.
- **The library's events feed refuses requests from Cloudflare** (HTTP 403), so GitHub Actions fetches it (TECH-DEBT
  **E1**). If that workflow stops, the Events tab keeps its last list and the cron warns after 26 hours.
- **The Transit job can't push to `main`** under the ruleset (TECH-DEBT **D8**). The next time Halifax Transit starts a new schedule, the job will fail at the push and the map keeps the old data until it changes.
- Cron expressions are in UTC, so routines run an hour later in Halifax local time from November to March.
