# TalkHalifax: tech debt

_Last reviewed November 7, 2026. Re-check every few weeks, and move items to "Paid off" when they land._

Things that work today but will cost us later: shortcuts, gaps and risks. Each item has a priority:

- **High:** it can put wrong facts on the site, take the site down, or block the next phase.
- **Medium:** it slows us down or will become high as volume grows.
- **Low:** tidy-up.

Size is a rough guess: **S** under an hour, **M** an afternoon, **L** a day or more.
The [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) says when each one is scheduled.

## Newsroom and content

| # | Item | Why it matters | Fix | Pri | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N5 | **r/halifax returns HTTP 429** to the Worker most of the time. | The Reddit signal is usually missing | Fetch it from the routine (not the Worker), or use Reddit's API with an app token. Or drop it, since it's only a signal | Low | M |
| N6 | **Cron times are UTC.** Routines run an hour later in Halifax from November to March. | Briefings land at 7 a.m. in winter and 8 a.m. in summer | Change the crons twice a year (put a reminder in OPERATING-MODEL.md), or let the briefing say its own time | Low | S |
| N7 | **The seed articles are out of date.** `scripts/articles/` holds 9 October stories for local runs. | Local testing doesn't look like the live site (no notices, RCMP or conditions stories) | Replace them with a handful of current stories of each kind, exported from the live site | Low | S |

## Code and tooling

| # | Item | Why it matters | Fix | Pri | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | **Few automated tests (first slice done Nov. 5).** `npm test` covers screening, stage and check-in timing, approvals, bans, rate limits and library events; `npm run test:e2e` opens every page and story kind in a browser; CI runs both before deploy. Still untested: chat in the room, sign-in beyond sign-up limits, push, source parsers. Before Nov. 5: CI type checks and parses `app.js`, then deploys. Nothing checks screening, auth, stage rules, approvals or the MCP tools. | Every push to `main` goes live untested, and agents will be making more of the changes | Add Vitest with `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`. Start with the rules that protect facts and people: screening rules, check-in and stage timing, pending updates, bans, rate limits. Run them in CI before deploy | High | L |
| C4 | **One big client file.** `public/app.js` (about 1,270 lines) holds every view, and `public/index.html` (about 730 lines) holds all the CSS. No build step. | Phase 6 (service worker, push, offline) adds more. Merges and reviews get harder | Split into ES modules served as static files (`views/`, `chat.js`, `api.js`) and move the CSS to `styles.css`. Still no bundler | Medium | M |
| C5 | **`src/mcp.ts` keeps growing** (about 600 lines, 22 tools in one switch). | Every new source or agent adds to it | Split into `mcp/stories.ts`, `mcp/leads.ts`, `mcp/desk.ts` with a shared tool table | Low | M |
| C7 | **Push alerts are sent from one request.** A Worker request can make only 50 outgoing requests on the Free plan (1,000 on Paid), and each alert is one. | Past about 40 subscribers on Free, some won't get an alert | Send through a Cloudflare Queue in batches, or move to the Paid plan. Check which plan the account is on: it's very likely Paid, since logs reach past Free's 3 days (Cloudflare review, Nov. 7), but that isn't confirmed. Keep this open until the editor checks the Billing page | Medium | M |
| C9 | **The custom domains live only in the dashboard.** The six addresses (`talkhalifax.ca`, `.com`, `.org` and their `www`) aren't in `wrangler.jsonc`, so the config doesn't show how the site is reached. | Someone reading the repo can't see them, and a change to them isn't reviewed | **Waiting on the editor:** the deploy token needs Zone › Workers Routes › Edit on all three zones first. Then add them as `routes` with `custom_domain: true`, and set `"workers_dev": true` in the same change, or Wrangler turns off the `workers.dev` address the newsroom agents, Telegram and the Events job use. Leave `admin.talkhalifax.ca` out. Tell the Cloudflare session before the push | Low | S |
| C10 | **The Content Security Policy only reports** (since Nov. 7). It blocks nothing, and with no reporting address, violations only show in each visitor's browser console. | It doesn't yet stop an injected script, and we can't see whether it would break anything | After a few days with no real violations, collect reports first (a `report-to` address, or another browser walk-through like the Nov. 7 one), then switch the header to `Content-Security-Policy` in `src/index.ts` as its own change | Medium | S |
| C8 | **The service worker's caches are versioned by hand** (`VERSION` in `public/sw.js`). Everything is network-first, so deploys show up anyway, but a change to what's cached needs the version bumped. | Old cached files can linger offline | Bump `VERSION` when the cached file list changes; later, stamp it at deploy | Low | S |

## Data, privacy and operations

| # | Item | Why it matters | Fix | Pri | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | **`message_index` is never pruned.** It keeps a copy of every chat message forever, and room storage keeps the history of archived rooms. | It grows without limit, and the privacy page should say how long chat is kept | Decide a retention period (for example 12 months), delete older rows in the cron, and say so on `/#privacy` | Medium | S |
| D2 | **No written restore plan.** D1 Time Travel can restore the last 30 days, but nobody has tried it, and Durable Object chat storage isn't covered. | A bad migration or a bulk delete could lose stories or chat | Write a short runbook (`wrangler d1 time-travel`), try it once against a copy, and add a weekly D1 export to R2. R2 isn't enabled on the account yet (Nov. 7), so that export has nowhere to go and there's no backup off the platform | Medium | M |
| D6 | **Request logs connect a signed-in reader's account to their IP address and location.** The Worker tells a chat room who's joining with `x-th-*` headers (`room()` in `src/index.ts`), and Workers Logs records them for up to 7 days beside the request's IP address. The privacy notice says so. | A record of who read which chat, from where, for longer than the site needs it | Pass who's joining some other way, such as a Durable Object method call, or turn off invocation logs and lose the request history used for reviews. Check the logs afterwards and update the notice | Medium | S |
| D7 | **The admin site's password is its only lock** (editor's choice, Nov. 7: Cloudflare Access was too much setup for now). The session cookie is signed with a key made from the password, the limit is 5 tries a minute per IP address with no limit across all addresses, and Sign out doesn't end a copied cookie, which lasts 12 hours. | A weak password, or a stolen cookie (which lets someone test passwords offline), would open the member list. Stage 2 lets the admin site change data, which raises the stakes | Before stage 2: move to Cloudflare Access (set `ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` and `ACCESS_AUD`, and the code switches over), or sign sessions with a separate random secret and add a limit across all addresses | Medium | S |
| D5 | **Personal email addresses are still in git history** (accepted for now). The repo is public. `ADMIN_EMAILS` left the config on Nov. 6, but past commits still show it, and every commit's author email shows too. They aren't on the site. | Anyone can read them | The editor chose on Nov. 6 to keep the repo public and leave history as it is. Going private would hide them; check the routines' GitHub access first | Low | S |

## Docs

| # | Item | Fix | Pri | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| X1 | `docs/PLATFORM.md` is a snapshot. It goes stale every time a feature lands, unless someone updates it. | Make "update PLATFORM.md" part of every feature's definition of done. The docs-keeper agent owns this | Low | S |

## Paid off

- **Nov. 7, 2026:** security headers on every response from the main site, with the content policy report-only for now (**C10**). The privacy notice now says what Cloudflare's request logs hold. Refused message text no longer goes to the logs, and password reset tokens no longer appear in URLs.
- **Nov. 7, 2026:** the admin site (stage 1, read-only) is live behind a username and password, with anonymous counts behind its charts.
- **Nov. 6, 2026:** the Transit map's schedule data rebuilds itself each week once a new schedule starts, tested and deployed without a tap (editor's request), and the cron warns in the schedule's last week (**N8**).
- **Nov. 6, 2026:** a smaller weather feed is back for the header line (current conditions only, no tides or forecasts), at the editor's request.
- **Nov. 6, 2026:** Turnstile is on for sign-up, with tests for accepted, rejected, missing and unreachable checks (**D3**).
- **Nov. 5, 2026:** the weather and tides feed and the unused road and Transit detour collection are removed (editor's decision). Weather warnings stay, and a failed refresh now reaches the cron's warning.
- **Nov. 5, 2026:** first automated tests, run by CI before every deploy (**C1**, first slice; the rest stays open above).
- **Nov. 5, 2026:** GitHub Actions upgraded to `checkout` and `setup-node` v7, which end the Node 20 warnings.
- **Nov. 5, 2026:** library events reach the site through a GitHub Action, because the feed refuses Cloudflare (**E1**, editor's decision).
- **Nov. 4, 2026:** the journalist reads its prompt from the repo like the other agents (**N4**).
- **Nov. 5, 2026:** wrangler 4.158.0, `@cloudflare/workers-types` 5.20261104.1, TypeScript 5.9.3 and
  `compatibility_date` 2026-10-01 (**C3**). TypeScript 7 is left for later.
- **Nov. 5, 2026:** one line-ending rule, LF everywhere, enforced by `.gitattributes` (**C6**).
- **Nov. 4, 2026:** live weather and outage notices are due a check-in every hour and listed by `conditions` as
  `openNotices` from any day (**N1**). The stale notice came from a day boundary: Nov. 4's `conditions` only knew
  Nov. 4's id, so the Nov. 3 notice dropped out of view.
- **Nov. 4, 2026:** outage notices restore below 500 and reopen only above 2,000 (**N2**).
- **Nov. 4, 2026:** numbers-only changes to live notices publish without a tap and are reported after (**N3**).
- **Nov. 4, 2026:** `publish_story` and `update_story` reject unknown fields. Agents had been sending `status`,
  which was silently dropped, so "Restored" never reached the site.
- **Nov. 4, 2026:** CI smoke-tests the live site after each deploy and rolls back if it fails (**C2**).
- **Nov. 4, 2026:** the cron tells the editor after 2 failed runs of a job in a row, and when it recovers (**D4**).

- **Nov. 4, 2026:** the agent prompts now say to use the field `text`, not `message`, for `notify_editor` (`a533f80`).
- **Nov. 4, 2026:** PLATFORM.md lists all five agents (it listed only the journalist).
